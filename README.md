# MUSDTA
MUSDTA is an advanced computational framework for predicting drugâ€“target binding affinity (DTA). By integrating multimodal feature fusion and structural modeling, it comprehensively captures the complex interactions between drugs and targets, aiming to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of drug discovery.

# Dependency
